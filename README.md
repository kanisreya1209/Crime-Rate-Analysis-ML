# 🚔 Crime Rate Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Crime Rate Analysis is a Machine Learning-based application that predicts crime rates based on historical crime data.  
The system helps identify crime patterns and supports law enforcement agencies in making data-driven decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze crime trends across different locations and time periods  
- Predict future crime rates using ML models  
- Provide an interactive dashboard for visualization  
- Help in preventive planning and crime control  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Streamlit Web Framework  
- Pickle (Model Saving)
